## credit-risk-classification
Python and supervised learning were used to train and evaluate a model based on loan data from a peer-to-peer lending services company. The purpose of the model is to identify the creditworthiness of borrowers and minimize risk to the lending institution. This analysis was completed using the following modules and libraries in Python:
* numpy as np
* pandas as pd
* pathlib Path
* sklearn.metrics confusion_matrix, classification_report, accuracy_score

I relied upon previous activities and examples from the UC Berkeley Data Analytics Bootcamp to complete the project in June 2024 using Jupyter Lab.
